I few weeks ago I bought a Dell Optiplex GX110 tower for 5$ from a church garage sale at Bathurst and College.
It is a very late i810E chipset based computer that supports Coppermine Pentium 3 and Celeron CPUs natively.
I have a top of the line Tualatin Pentium 3-S 1.4GHz with 512KB L2 cache in Upgradeware Slocket, so I was really hoping it will have a Slot 1 version of motherboard and a riser with ISA slots.
Unfortunately it was a Socket 370 motherboard and 1424d riser with 5 PCI slots.
I ended up buying on eBay a brand new 0524d riser with 5 PCI and 4 ISA slots, only two are shared.
Price plus delivery was an obscene 80$, more then many modern budget motherboards.
I also upgraded a 733EB Coppermine P3 to a 1000EB.
I got it for 5$ from my favorite [computer junk store](https://aboveallelectronicsurplus.wordpress.com/).
I hope to eventually either find a Lin-Lin Tualatin Socket 370 adapter I bought long time ago or do a pin mod on Tualatin CPU directly, so I can run it with 1.4GHz P3-S.
On the down side, i810E only supports up to 512MB of RAM. It's not a big issue, since it will be running DOS and Windows 98 SE.

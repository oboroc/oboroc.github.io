Today I received my package with Everdrive N64.
My unit is version 3.02 and it has USB port.
The stickers are super cool, thanks a lot, folks at [RetroGate][].
I still need to buy a donor cartridge for plastic shell and CIC chip.
Hopefully I can buy one on Monday.
If I'm lucky, I'll find blue, red or black cartridges, not the standard Nintendo grey.
According to this [list][] there was plenty of non-grey games.

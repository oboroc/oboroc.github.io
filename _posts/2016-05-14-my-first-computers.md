I really wanted to get my own computer since 1990, when I started writing my own programs.
It didn't help that my classmate, Vlad Khokholkhov, got a full blown PC XT clone with hipster amber monochrome monitor at home.

My family wasn't crazy rich. My parents are doctors, not apparatchiks or oligarchs,
but they where really awesome and bought me a Kvorum-64 8-bit computer as a high school graduation gift.
The cost was something around 600 rubles, which was cheaper then normal store price, but in 1992 it still was about 2 months worth of combined parents salary.
It was beautiful and worked really well. It was one of the better russian clones of ZX Spectrum 48. Here is a photo by Andshel, CC BY-SA 3.0, from russian Wikipedia page about Kvorum:

It was designed my [Kamil "caro" Karimov](http://caro.su/), who is now famous for designing great hardware upgrades for Yamaha KUVT MSX computers
and for fixing bugs and adding features to [1chipMSX FPGA project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1chipMSX).

After playing [Elite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)) and
[OCP Video Pool](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005566) for far too much,
I started doing lots of drawing in OCP Art Studio, and writing lots of ZX Basic programs to experiment with graphics and sound.
Using soviet tape player for storage was really unreliabe, chances of reading back what I saved was 50/50.
Plus my mom was always limiting amount of time I could use it, as I just started studying at University
and also because she was worried that using computer on our family color TV would somehow break it.
I would only be allowed to use it for 2-3 hours a week, and it was pissing me off crazy.
I'm still slightly pissed even now, more then 20 years later, but I also acknowledge that this limit probably helped me make through first two really brutal years at University.
Soviet style universities were a lot more like Hunger Games, only the brightest or those that were really good at cheating could survive.

Eventually I persuaded my parents again to give me lots of cash to buy a soviet monochrome monitor.
This 10" monitor was amazingly crisp, pixels were never so sharp on big color TV.
I used RF video out, because that was all that either family color TV or my monochrome monitor would allow.
By 1994 Kvorum broke down, and at the time I was very bad with digital electronics.
I tried to fix it, but damaged it further, got upset and trashed the whole thing, which I really regret now.

While all this was happening, I had a fairly generous, although limited access to PC XT clones with color EGA monitors at University.
I could use them for at least 2-3 hours every working week day.
This promoted a very cool programming and debugging technique, where I would write down the subroutines on paper and then execute it using my mind and side notes.
Because I had to keep a lot of stuff in my mind, it naturally led to habits such as writing small, single purpose functions that depended only on input parameters,
and each function would have a test mini-function that would feed it predefined input and validate output against known correct results.
Many years later I learned that what I was doing is actually [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)),
[functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

By 1993 I managed to get a part-time job as lab assistant in computer room at my University.
Money wasn't great, but I would've done it even for free.
The class I managed had about 10 gorgeous IBM PS/2 Model 50 286 10MHz PCs with 1MB RAM, 20MB HDD, clicky model M keyboards and greyscale monochrome 12" monitors.
As a very junior member of staff, I could use a really cool 386SX 16MHz PC with 2MB RAM and 100MB HDD with 13" VGA color monitor, but only after 6:00pm, after everyone else left.
Later that year I also got a paid programming gig at ASE (Academy of Economic Studies) and got access to an amazing 386 DX40 system and I think a 15" VGA monitor.
It was wonderous. I wrote some software for statistic modelling. It featured TUI user interface using Borland Turbo Vision and 640x480 16 color VGA graphics for plotting graphs.
It also allowed printing graphics out to EPSON compatible dot-matrix printers using ESC/P codes.

In 1996 my awesome parents bought me my first PC.
It cost us 1600 US$, a huge amount of money, more then a years worth of mom's salary at the time.
I remember clearly that it was a Pentium 120MHz system, overclocked to 133MHz (FSB 60MHz -> 66MHz).
It had 16MB of memory in EDO SIMMs, a glitchy Cirrus PCI VGA card with 1MB RAM,
a Sound Blaster Pro compatible ISA sound card with ESS AudioDrive 688 chipset,
a single-speed IDE CDROM I got for free from a generous colleague at University,
a 1.7GB IDE HDD and a 3.5" floppy drive.
The sound card I actually bought myself in 1994 and rocked it until 1996 in my University computer lab.
PC was housed in AT mid-tower case.
It came with affordable but really good Mitsumi keyboard and mouse.

My memory is hazy, but most likely my PC had an ASUS P2T4 motherboard, one of the last ones with DALLAS RTC clock chip.
PCI VGA card was most likely based on CL-GD5434 chip. The hard drive was most likely Fujitsu.

I wrote my [graduation thesis and supporting program](https://github.com/oboroc/hycon) on this PC.
I also wrote an [LBM file loaded for Allegro game programming library](http://cd.textfiles.com/scene96-2/graphics/tools/lbmview/lbmview.c).
It was eventually included in Allegro 2.2, but I think it was dropped around version 5.0 along with other DOS, Atari ST and Amiga code.
LBM was native file format of EA Deluxe Paint on Amiga and PC and for a while it was primary format for demo scene pixel art.

I ended up selling my first PC 1.5 years later for 700 US$ and was very happy about the money I got for it.
I am a bit nostalgic and wish I kept it, but that would've been way too expensive.
I needed 700 US$ for my 1998 PC. It was built around AMD K6 300MHz CPU, Nvidia Riva TNT 16MB, Gravis Ultrasound PnP with 8MB sample RAM, 2x2x4 HP CD-RW drive and ASUS motherboard, probably P5A-B.
I don't really have any fond memories about my second PC, even though I was much better then my first PC.

I upgraded again in early 2000 to a system based on fresh and exciting Slot-A AMD Athlon 700MHz CPU.
It had Asus K7V motheboard, 128MB PC-100 SDRAM, 20GB IBM HDD, Sound Blaster 128 PCI audio card, Matrox Millennium G450 AGP video card.
This is the PC I took with me to Canada, it served me well until 2002, when I sold it to my coworked and got myself a new system based on Athlon XP 1700.

For a while now I've had a lingering low intensity pain in my right shoulder.
Three weeks ago I tried to do some push ups to deal with it.
I managed 3 with great difficulty.
I weight 286 lbs, so pushing my body up was very hard.
I got pretty pissed at my weakness and started doing some push-ups every other day.
At first 3, then 5 and eventually 10 at a time.
Morbid obesity and push-ups exposed that my left shoulder was unstable.
It was popping out from its socket while shoulder was relaxed due to atrophied muscles.
Thankfully push-ups and kettle bell "halo" excercise let me take control of it.
Today I did 100 push-ups and my posterior deltoids feel tired.
I'm sure I can do another 20 or 30 push-ups if I really wanted, but I don't want to push it too hard.
It is so easy so screw something up by trying too hard while skeletal-muscular system is not yet up to it.
I'm glad my upper pectorials got pretty big.
I've already looked up excercise modifications to improve lower pectorials.

Also, I think fish oil capsules do help with shoulder joint pain.

And I need to do something about CSS for this site, it's awful at the moment.

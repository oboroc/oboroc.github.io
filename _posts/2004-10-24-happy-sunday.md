Last week I had an "International Beer Weekend #1". The participants were:

* Latvian blonde "Zelta" - so so;
* Czech (Prague) "Staropramex" - very good;
* Russian Baltika #3 - so so;
* Croatian Karlovacko - so so.

Despite somewhat questionable quality of beers, it was a lot of fun. I loved
the idea so much that this weekend is "International Beer Weekend #2":

* Ukranian Lvivske - didn't try it yet;
* Ukranian Slavutich - bad;
* Slovak Golden Pheasant - very good;
* British Monty Python's Holy Ail - worst of all, but "tempered over burning
witches"!

Again, fantastic experience. I hope I'll get around to "International Beer
Weekend #3" someday.

On unrelated note, I was scouting runet steppe and came across a rather
interesting article from Viktor Shenderovich:
<http://www.shender.ru/paper/text/?.file=51>. It is about political climate in
Russia. The prose looks like it was inspired by Viktor Pelevin. In Soviet times
author would've disappeared without a trace for daring to challenge powers that
be.

I've printed out an article on Xbox programming from
<http://www.hydras-world.com/gaming/xbox/retail-to-debug/>.
It doens't seem to be very complicated. The article is quite old, so I'll need
to find out what is the latest greatest replacement BIOS that supports debug
mode.

I really need to reinstall my home PC. May be I should try a dual boot system
with Gentoo on second partition. My buddy seems to be in love with that
distro.

Nothing interesting on TV. The soup is warming up. Everything goes acording to
the plan.

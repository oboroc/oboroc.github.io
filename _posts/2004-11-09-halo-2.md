I just bought Halo 2 special edition for Xbox. It comes in a cool aluminum case
with extra DVD, filled with useless stuff (interview with developers, removed
scenes etc.)

I pre-ordered it with 10$ down, as a result I got lots of freebies:
baseball hat with Halo 2 logo, two boxed spartans (a red and a blue one) and
one loose master chief (green) in a plastic bag. May be I'll take some pictures
later.

Tonight I'll be saving Earth from illegal immigrants from space. Jos mafia!

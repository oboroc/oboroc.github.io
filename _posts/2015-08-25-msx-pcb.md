Just got my order from [Alexey at MRC forum](http://www.msx.org/forum/msx-talk/trading-and-collecting/several-msx-related-boards-are-available-sale).
PCBs look to be top notch quality. I got 4x prototyping PCB, 2x 512KB flash cartridge and 2x 1MB RAM modules for Yamaha YIS503 MSX computers,
with all but SRAM components for one of them.

I hope to start soldering soon, stay tuned!

Just released first stable version of bdecli - Borland Database Engine command-line configuration tool:
<https://github.com/oboroc/bdecli/releases/tag/v1.0.3>.

It was formerly known as idapi32cfg and hosted at CodePlex.
I moved to GitHub and renamed it to help with discoverability.
Googling for idapi32cfg was pretty pointless - Google treated it same as idapi32.cfg, the file this tool is intended for.

Current version 1.0.3 is 100% compatible with idapi32cfg 1.0.0 that was released in April 2010.
It does have one serious [bug][] fixed, so updating from idapi32cfg 1.0.0 is a good idea.

For next release it would be great to switch from internal linked list to [uthash][].

After that it would be nice to make bdicli similar to internal Windows reg.exe utility.
That will probably be version 2.0.x according to [semantic versioning][] due to backwards compatibility break.

[bug]: https://github.com/oboroc/bdecli/commit/75cb74338b90cc907a9d7b81a87f8b5bc95c55c6
[uthash]: https://github.com/troydhanson/uthash
[semantic versioning]: http://semver.org

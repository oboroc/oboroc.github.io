This is a follow-up to my first [Everdrive N64 post](http://www.oboroc.com/posts/2014/11/29/everdrive-n64/).

I got a blue donor cartridge with Bassmasters 2000 game for 4.50$:

Unfortunately, I broke one of the two hooks that hold the shell together at the bottom.
I still ended up using CIC chip from the PCB.

Here is the Everdrive N64 with trasnplant CIC chip soldered in:

Next I got a back donor cartridge with Madden 2002 game for 5.65$.
This time I managed to open it without damage.
I filed holes for SD card and mini-USB socket.
Also I had to remove some plastic from inside to fit in large Everdrive N64 PCB:

Here are the two pieces of shielding.
I've straightened top edges to fit in full sized Everdrive 64 PCB and cut a bit of metal from place where battery is going to be:

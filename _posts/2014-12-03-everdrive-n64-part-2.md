This is a follow-up to my first [Everdrive N64 post](http://www.oboroc.com/posts/2014/11/29/everdrive-n64/).

I got a blue donor cartridge with Bassmasters 2000 game for 4.50$:

Unfortunately, I broke one of the two hooks that hold the shell together at the bottom.
I still ended up using CIC chip from the PCB.

Here is the Everdrive N64 with trasnplant CIC chip soldered in:

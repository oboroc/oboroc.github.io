I bought a Matrox Millennium G450 16MB AGP video card.
I assume it's an OEM version that came from a recycled old corporate desktop.
It has a very sharp ramdac on primary VGA port: 360MHz.
That's more then 300MHz on Matrox Millennium G400 32MB AGP video card I got earlier.
It's also what I had in my PC in year 2000: Athlon 700MHz, ASUS A7V, 128MB RAM, SB 128 PCI.
I remember paying lots of money, something around 200 US$ for it back then.

I upgraded the bios to the latest version 2.1.
I took the backup of bios 1.6 that was on the videocard.

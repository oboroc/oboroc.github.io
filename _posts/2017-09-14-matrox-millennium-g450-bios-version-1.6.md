I bought a Matrox Millennium G450 16MB AGP video card.
I assume it's an OEM version that came from a recycled old corporate desktop.
It has a sharp 360MHz ramdac on primary VGA port.
That's more then 300MHz on Matrox Millennium G400 32MB AGP video card I got earlier.
It's also what I had in my PC back in 2000.

I upgraded the bios to the latest version 2.1.
I took the backup of bios 1.6 that was on the videocard.
Grab it here if you're interested:

Update: I also dumped a [Matrox G400 AGP BIOS v1.5](/files/2017-09-14-matrox-g400-v1.5-b22.zip).

A little over a month ago I saw an article on Slashdot about
[cheap and capable Realtek RTL2832U software defined radio dongle](http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/16/01/27/1654246/collecting-private-flight-data-on-the-world-economic-forum-attendees-with-rtl-sdr).
It was under 20$, so I ordered it on impulse. It took a while, but finally it arrived!

I hope I can start scanning radio waves for interesting radio trasmissions. It should [work with GNU Radio](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr).
I'm not yet sure which tuner chip it uses, but most likely it's Rafael Micro R820T.

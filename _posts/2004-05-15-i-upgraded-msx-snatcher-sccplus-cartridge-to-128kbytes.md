Yay! It worked! As usual I made a mistake first, and soldered the first chip
wrong way. Desoldering was slow and painful, but eventually I did it. After
this I resoldered both chips correctly and tested the cart in my MSX TurboR GT.
It worked! All but four Konami megarom games can be played with upgraded SCC+.
Exceptions are: Metal Gear 2, Nemesis 3: Gofer, Knightmare 3: Shalom and
Space Manbow. It is ok, I can still play those on
[Padial's flash cartridge](http://msx.deneb.nl/page0.HTM).
It is just too much trouble flashing it - each time I have to switch four
jumpers...

Big thanks to [BiFi](http://www.bifi.msxnet.org) for writing
[SCC+ Rom Loader](http://www.bifi.msxnet.org/?main=/downloads/bifi_idx.html).

I did a fairly decent job at opening the case. Unfortunately I damaged two tiny
plastic hooks on sides of the cartridge case. At least I didn't make too many
visible scratches. I guess I'll have to use a bit of superglue to put
everything back together.

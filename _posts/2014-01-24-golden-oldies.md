I finally found the url for my decade old MSX blog: pentaro.blogspot.com.
It is long since gone, but a snapshot lingers in Internet Archive:

I decided to restore my old posts, now they are up!
Of special interest is the "Microsoft News Release" post :)

Update: found another, even earlier attempt at blagging (in Russian!)

Translated and imported old posts from it.

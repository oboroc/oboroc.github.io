I recently bough an XT-class computer.
Inside it had a 1984 model of Quadram Quadboard multi-function 8-bit ISA card.

I noticed it had a soldered in Vatra Ni-Cd rechargeable battery on it.
Those batteries often leak acid when fully discharged.
The acid destroys PCB tracks and makes restoring a chore.

My cards battery didn't leak yet, but I decided to remove it anyway.

I replaced it with CR2032 - a non-rechargeable lithium coin cell.
I installed it in series with a diode I removed from a dead motherboard.
The diode is probably schottky, since voltage drop is only about 0.3V.

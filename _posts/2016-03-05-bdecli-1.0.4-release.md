[bdecli v1.0.4](https://github.com/oboroc/bdecli/releases/tag/v1.0.4) release is available for download.
bdecli is a Borland Database Engine command-line configuration tool.

[@josealf](https://github.com/josealf) submitted a patch for a serious bug:
[4a48981](https://github.com/oboroc/bdecli/commit/4a489819aa564671dc71b9f5bbd3225f62852ecb).

bdecli is an updated version of [idapi32cfg 1.0.0](http://idapi32cfg.codeplex.com/) I released back in April 2010.
It has two serious bugs fixed: [75cb743](https://github.com/oboroc/bdecli/commit/75cb74338b90cc907a9d7b81a87f8b5bc95c55c6) and
[4a48981](https://github.com/oboroc/bdecli/commit/4a489819aa564671dc71b9f5bbd3225f62852ecb).
If you use idapi32cfg, please update it to bdecli v1.0.4.

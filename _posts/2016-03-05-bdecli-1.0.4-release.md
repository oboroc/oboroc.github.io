I released bdecli v1.0.4 on February 4, 2016: <https://github.com/oboroc/bdecli/releases/tag/v1.0.4>.

bdecli is a Borland Database Engine command-line configuration tool I wrote in March 2010.

Thanks to @josealf for submitting patch for a serious bug 4a489819aa564671dc71b9f5bbd3225f62852ecb.

Current version 1.0.4 is 100% compatible with idapi32cfg 1.0.0 that was released in April 2010.
It has two serious bugs fixed: 75cb74338b90cc907a9d7b81a87f8b5bc95c55c6 and 4a489819aa564671dc71b9f5bbd3225f62852ecb.
If you use idapi32cfg, please update it to bdecli v1.0.4.

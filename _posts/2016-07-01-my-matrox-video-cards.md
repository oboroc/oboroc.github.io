A couple of days ago I bought an original Matrox Millennium PCI SVGA video card.
It's a DELL OEM rev. B version with 220MHz RAMDAC and 4MB WRAM on-board.
Board layout and component placement is really beautiful:

Back in it's heyday this card was selling for around 600$.
Needless to say I used a much cheaper and slower noname PCI SVGA card with Cirrus Logic CL-GD5436 chipset and 1MB DRAM.
I can't quite explain why it's so much fun to play around with stuff that was way out of reach when it was current, but it is.

Out of curiosity I searched online for BIOS update and found this amazing resource:

[BIOS updates for Matrox Millennium, Millennium II, Mistique, Mistique 220, Productiva G100, Millennium G200, G200MMS, G400, G450, G450MMS, G550, P650 and P750 and Parhelia](http://video.rom.by/matrox/recovery/html/home2.htm)

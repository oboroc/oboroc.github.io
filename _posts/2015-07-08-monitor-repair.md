Someone trashed a monitor. I took it home. It is a discontinued Insignia 24" LED 1920x1080 monitor from 2013.
Model name is [NS-24EM51A14](http://www.insigniaproducts.com/products/computer-speakers-accessories/NS-24EM51A14.html).

Plugging it showed no signs of life. I disassembled it. Thankfully it was very easy.
It uses snap-in bezel and some duct tape to keep stuff together inside.

As I was disassembling it, I noticed a loose flat ribbon cable, but thought it's just something for diagnostics.
I removed the metal shield box, and in it was power supply and main boards. I checked power supply for blown fuse or
leaking electrolytes, but didn't find any issues. Then it dawned on me, I checked the bezel and found it had a control
PCB in it with a connector for small flat ribbon cable! I reapplied sticky metal and duct tape as it was before,
reconnected the cable to the bezel, and snapped bezel back. Tested the monitor and it works!

Sadly it's not a great monitor. Poorly built, with horrible stand, as expected from Bestbuy's store brand stuff.
In it's hey days it sold for 120$ and was 80$ on sale. I'll be lucky to get 20$ for it. But since my awesome
Dell UltraSharp 2405FPW is loosing brightness fast, I may even end up using it.

*asmsx* is a cross-assembler that was created by [Eduardo "pitpan" Robsy][] of [msxdev competition][] fame.
After a decade of excellent work, Eduardo decided to discontinue MSX-related activities.
In April 2011 he announced [sale of all right][] to asmsx on eBay.
cjv99 won the auction and [released source][] under GPLv3 license.

For the past two years I was hoping someone will take over the project, translate it and continue with further development, but no one did.
I decided to give it a try myself. asmsx is free software, so it was pretty easy start.
I now post my patches to [asmsx-cleanup][] project on Github.

_December 17, 2013 update_: translation is now complete!

_December 29, 2013 update_: moved project to GitHub

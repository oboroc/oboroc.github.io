This is mostly for myself in the future.
Memory speeds required to run at 0 wait states at different frequencies:

| CPU frequency in MHz | Memory speed in ns |
|----------------------|--------------------|
|         4.77         |         200        |
|            6         |         150        |
|            8         |         120        |
|           10         |         100        |
|         12.5         |          80        |
|           16         |          60        |

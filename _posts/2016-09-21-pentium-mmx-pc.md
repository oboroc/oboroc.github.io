A while ago I wrote a post about a [PC with M571 motherboard](/posts/2016/05/13/m571-retro-pc/) I bought.

Since then I got a better CPU and motherboard for this system.

Current specs:

* ASUS TX97-E motherboard
* Intel Pentium MMX 233MHz CPU
* 32MB PC66 SDRAM DIMM
* [Matrox Millennium 4MB](/posts/2016/07/01/matrox-millennium/)
* 15GB 5200RPM Seagate HDD
* Plextor 8x4x32 CD burner
* 3.5" and 5.25" HD floppy drives
* IBM EtherJet 10/100 PCI network card
* Sound Blaster 64 ISA sound card
* shielded audio cable between CD burner and Sound Blaster

I reconfigured frequency indicator from showing 200 to 233 and
cleaned everything thoroughly, so now it looks pretty fresh.

This would've been am amazing PC for 1997 and even 1998.
It's certainly much better that my first PC from 1996.

I'll let it air a bit to get rid of agressive cleaning chemicals
and then wrap it in plastic and move it to storage.

Update
------

* replaced Plextor 8x4x32 CD burner with an LG GDR-8161B DVD-ROM drive, updated firmware from 1.00 to 1.02
* replaced Sound Blaster 64 with Sound Blaster 16 CT1950 with Waveblaster II CT1910 daughterboard
* upgraded memory from dual-sided 32MB PC66 to single-sided 64MB PC133 DIMM

To do
-----

* find shorter metal sockets to support motherboard, so AT keyboard post is better alligned with case
* replace constant speed CPU cooler with molex connector with a 3-pin variable speed fan cooler

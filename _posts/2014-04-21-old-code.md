Just published my surviving projects from mid-90s. So much is lost!
I uploaded everything as-is, warts and all. Ridiculous spelling mistakes,
weird 90s demo scene slang, early Internet optimism.

Here is the list of projects:

* _hycon_ - Hypergraph Converter <https://github.com/oboroc/hycon>
* _msxpic_ - MSX SCREEN 8 picture viewer <https://github.com/oboroc/msxpic>
* _crux_ - simple game <https://github.com/oboroc/crux>
* _rc_ - change ASCII text code page <https://github.com/oboroc/rc>

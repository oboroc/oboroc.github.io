Just published my surviving projects from mid-90s. So much is lost!
I uploaded everything as-is, warts and all. Ridiculous spelling mistakes,
weird 90s demo scene slang, early Internet optimism.

Here is the list of projects:

* [hycon](https://github.com/oboroc/hycon) - Hypergraph Converter
* [msxpic](https://github.com/oboroc/msxpic) - MSX SCREEN 8 picture viewer
* [crux](https://github.com/oboroc/crux) - simple game
* [rc](https://github.com/oboroc/rc) - change ASCII text code page

[bdecli v1.0.5](https://github.com/oboroc/bdecli/releases/tag/v1.0.5) release is available for download.
bdecli is a Borland Database Engine command-line configuration tool.

Changes since v1.0.4:

* changed license from Apache 2.0 to GPLv3;
* fixed warnings from vs2019 and cppcheck 1.87;
* rewrote bde_fqn() for better memory management;
* executable files are now compiled with vs2019;
* executable files now have a Windows resource block with an icon and a version number.

bdecli is an updated version of [idapi32cfg 1.0.0](http://idapi32cfg.codeplex.com/) I released back in April 2010.
It has two serious bugs fixed: [75cb743](https://github.com/oboroc/bdecli/commit/75cb74338b90cc907a9d7b81a87f8b5bc95c55c6) and
[4a48981](https://github.com/oboroc/bdecli/commit/4a489819aa564671dc71b9f5bbd3225f62852ecb).
If you use idapi32cfg 1.0.0, please update it to bdecli v1.0.5.

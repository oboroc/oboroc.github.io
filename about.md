Hi there! My name is Adrian Oboroc.
I'm a typical corporate IT guy by day, average skilled gamer by night, and this is my personal site.
I live in Toronto, dabble in simple electronics and love old 8-bit computers.
I play a *Dark Souls 2* a bit.
I do some programming as a hobby: [github.com/oboroc](https://github.com/oboroc).

I'm a mellow and unambitious IT guy with mild programming and DIY electronics hobbies.

Currently I'm working at a great company, have fantastic colleagues and boss and hope it will last a little bit longer before everything inevitably goes sideways.

I enjoy Animal Kingdom, Fire Emblem and WarioWare games. Also I was huge on Guild Wars, but after a decade and about 20'000 hours logged can't really play it anymore.

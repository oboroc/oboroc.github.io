I'm a mellow and unambitious IT guy with mild programming and DIY electronics hobbies.

Currently I'm working at a great company, have fantastic colleagues and boss and hope it will last a little bit longer before everything inevitably goes sideways.

I enjoyed most Animal Kingdom, Fire Emblem and WarioWare games. Never got into modern military shooters, World of Warcraft or League of Legends.

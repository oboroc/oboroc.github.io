I work in IT and enjoy programming and DIY electronics as my hobbies.

Currently, I'm reading through
[Horus Heresy novels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horus_Heresy_%28novels%29).
Wikipedia has an
[elaborate reading order graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus_Heresy_%28fictional_event%29#/media/File:English_Horus_heresy_spoiler_free_tree.jpg),
but I mostly follow the order of publishing.

Books I finished are striken, book I am reading is bold:

1. ~~Horus Rising~~
2. ~~False Gods~~
3. ~~Galaxy in Flames~~
4. ~~The Flight of the Eisenstein~~
5. ~~Fulgrim~~

18. Deliverance Lost
19. ~~Know No Fear~~

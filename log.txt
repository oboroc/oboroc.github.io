I tried and can do just one push-up. Haven't done it in probably a year. May be more.

I tried again a few hours later, and managed to get 3 push-ups, but with great effort and with cracking in the right shoulder.

My muscles didn't recover well enough with one day rest. First push-up would always feel painful.
I discussed it with a colleague who is into weight lifting. He recommended taking more rest.
I took two days, and the pain is gone. I'm aiming at 5x25 with two days rest now.

5x25 push-ups.

#2023-01-31

5x25 push-ups.

Tried one push-up using fists. It is not too hard, easier on wrists,
but uses a major muscle in forearm that isn't used in normal push-ups.

#2023-02-02

5x25 - very easy, need to raise soon.

30 minutes on eliptical @ 145 heart rate. I decided to start doing some cardio, since my heart rate at rest seems a bit high.

#2023-02-12 to 2023-03-06

Was out of country. Continued to do 5x30 push-ups until I got sick. Then I could only manage 3x30. Back now and will try rebuild to 5x30.

#2023-03-18

Finally somewhat recovered and managed to do 3x20.

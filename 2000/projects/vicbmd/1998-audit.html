<p class=banner>Auditor's report</p>
<br>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Introduction</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>
We have audited the financial statements of Victoriabank, Chisinau, 
Republic of Moldova, for the year ended December 31, 1998. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the company's 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audit.
</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Scope</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.
</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Opinion</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>
In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
financial position of the company as of December 31, 1998 and of the result 
for the year then ended in accordance with International Accounting 
Standards. 
</p>

<p class=para>
Without further qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to the 
level of loan loss provisions in the financial statements. Although this 
indicative provision has been calculated according to standards that best 
follow international practice, estimates of likely future credit losses are 
difficult to make due to uncertainties in the economic environment in 
Moldova.

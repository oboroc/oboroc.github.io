<strong>Legal status and principal activities</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>The joint stock commercial Victoriabank was established in the Republic of
Moldova in 1989. The Bank was re-established as joint stock commercial bank
on 26 August 1991.</p>

<p class=para>Victoriabank is a comprehensive joint stock lending establishment, offering
a complete set of banking operations and services to small- and medium-sized
enterprises. The principal goal of the Bank is to promote, support and finance
private business and enterpreneurship, as well as create the conditions 
essential for the transformation from a central planed to market economy within 
the Republic of Moldova.</p>

<p class=para>As at 31 December 1997, the Bank has eight branches in Moldova, located 
in Chisinau, Balts, Tiraspol, Floreshti, Soroka, Nisporeni, Kaushany and 
Orhei.</p>

<p class=para>Victoriabank has received a blanket licence to execute operations in
foreign currencies. It established correcpondent relations with a number of
international banks.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Principles of presentation
<br>
<br>
General</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>The financial statements for the year 1997 have prepared in accordance with
International Accounting Standards.</p>

<p class=para>The Bank maintains its accounting records in accordance with the banking
regulations prevailing in Moldova and prepares its statutory financial
statements on such basis. Adjustments have been made in order to present the
financial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standards.</p>

<p class=para>The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, except for the tangible fixed assets. In accordance with the 
regulations as set by Ministry of Finance in Moldova, Victoriabank revalued
the fixed assets by applying indices to the cost price of certain categories 
of fixed assets.</p>

<p class=para>The financial statements have been prepared after the statutory 
appropriation of profit. All amounts are stated in Moldovan Lei unless 
otherwise noted.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Principles of consolidation</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>The 1997 financial statements include the figures of the branches in
Chisinau, Balts, Floreshti, Soroka, Nisporeni, Kaushany and Orhei but not the
Tiraspol branch. Previously, this was due to the uncertain political and
economical environment in the Trans-Dniester region.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Inflation</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>The rate of inflation for 1997 amounted to approximately 11.2% 
(1996: 15%).</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Economical and political risks affecting the Bank</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>The Bank faces a number of risks and challenges due to the political and 
economical instability in Moldova as a result of the transition from a 
centrally planed economy to a market economy. They may have a potentially 
negative effect on the financial position and operations of the Bank.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Accounting principles<br>
<br>
General</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Assets and liabilities are started at nominal value, unless mentioned 
otherwise.</p>
<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Foreign currency translation</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to
Lei at year-end exchange rates. The official exchange rate at year-end was 
Lei 4.66 - USD 1 (1996: Lei 4.65 - USD 1). Transactions and the resulting 
income and charges in foreign currencies are converted at the rate applicable
on transaction date. Exchange rate differences arising from the conversion of 
assets and liabilities are included in the profit and loss account.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Due from banks</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Advances to banks are valued at nominal value less a provision for doubtful
debts, if considered necessary.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Loans and advances to customers</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Loans and advances to customers are stated at nominal value, after
deduction of specific provisions for doubtful debts and a general loan loss 
provision.</p>

<p class=para>The specific provision for doubtful debts is calculated by classifying
credit exposures into certain categories of recoverability. The estimated
net realisable value of the collateral involved has been considered in 
determining the provisions for doubtful debts.</p>

<p class=para>A general loan loss provision has been formed to cover the general inherent 
risks in relation to existing loans which, although not separately identified, 
are known to be present in any portfolio.</p>

<p class=para>Charges to the profit and loss account for those provisions are included in 
the "Losses on loans and advances".</p>

<p class=para>In 1997 both growth of credits and improvement of relations between the Bank 
and borrowers took place. They were marked by: a variety of crediting subjects
and objects, use of different forms of security for repayment of credits, 
strengthening of control over the intended use of granted funds, and 
improvement of crediting methods. The Bank paid special attention to
strengthening of credit relations with permanent customers having their 
settlement accounts with "Victoriabank".</p>

<p class=para>Taking into account the role which credits play in the formation of earnings 
they are given primary consideration when determining priorities of activities.
Approach of the Bank to the credit policy is aimed at attainment of maximum
efficiency with an allowance of the admissible risk level. It is achieved 
based on through investigation of the borrower's financial position, knowledge 
of the market and forecasting of its development.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Interest bearing securities</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Interest bearing securities are stated at nominal value, except for State 
treasury bills wich are valued at the acquisition price plus accrued 
interest.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Investments</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Investments are carried at the lower of cost or market value.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Tangible fixed assets</strong><br>
</p>

accumulated depreciation. Fixed assets are partly revalued on the basis of
instructions of the Moldavian Ministry of Finance, which publishes the indices
to be applied to certain categories of fixed assets. The revaluation of the
fixed assets has been posted to the Revaluation reserve.</p>

<p class=para>Furniture and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis, over its
expected economic life, which varies from 2 to 5 years. The depreciation of
buildings is calculated on a straight-line basis over its expected economic
life of 40 years.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Operating income and expenses</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Income and expenses are attributed to the year to which they relate.</p>

An amount of Lei 1.3 million of loans provisionally written off in 1997
</center>
</p>
<br><br>

<p class=para>The loan portfolio includes loans to the Bank's shareholders amounting 
to Lei 2.5 million (1996: 4.3 million). The terms and conditions of those 
loans are similar to other loans granted in bank's ordinary course of 
business.</p>

<p class=para>The Bank's lending activities are conducted primarily in Moldova. There 
is no significant concentration of credit risk in one specific sector. The
ability of borrowers to repay their debts depends on a number of factors
including the overall financial health of individual borrowers and the 
Moldovan economy. In general, loans have been secured by collateral 
(inventory, equipment, cars, real estate, etceteras). As at 31 December 1997,
three customers have an outstanding balance higher than Lei 2.5 million (total

<strong>Transactions with related parties</strong><br>

<p class=para>The Bank has entered into a number of transactions with shareholders during
the year on an arm's length basis.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Financial instruments<br>
<br>
Introduction</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>As defined by IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation)
a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a financial
assets of one enterprise and a financial liability or equity instrument of
another enterprise.</p>

<p class=para>Within the balance sheet of the Bank, the majority of financial assets and 
liabilities are captured by this definition. Off-balance sheet items such as
letters of credit and guarantees are also included in the definition. IAS 32 
requires certain disclosure on the risks and fair values associated with 
financial instruments.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Interest rate risk</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Changes in the market interest rates have a direct impact on the
contractually determined cash flows associated with some financial assets and 
liabilities, when these bear interest rates which are periodically reset to
market rates, and on the fair value of others for which the interest rates are
fixed throughout the period of the contract.</p>

<p class=para>The residual maturity of assets and liabilities is presented in the notes to 
the balance sheet. Substantially almost all financial assets and a smaller
part of financial liabilities are interest bearing. Rates are set at or around
current market levels, using requirements set by and guidance from the National 
Bank of Moldova. Most of the Bank's assets and liabilities reprise within one
year and interest percentages can in many cases be changed upon the Bank's
discretion. Accordingly, there is little risk of a significant interest 
mismatch.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Credit risk</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Disclosure of credit risk enables the user of financial information to 
assess the extent to which failures by counterparts to discharge their 
obligations could reduce the amount of future cash inflows from financial 
assets on hand at the balance sheet date. In making this assessment,
consideration is given to the value of the collateral.</p>

<p class=para>The information required for this assessment can be obtained directly from 
the balance sheet and related notes with respect to credit risk exposure, such
as loans and advances, guarantees and letters of credit.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Fair value</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Fair value information is widely used in determining an enterprise's overall
financial position and in making decision about individual financial 
instruments. It is also relevant to many decisions made by users of financial
statements since, in many circumstances, it reflects the judgement of the
financial markets as to the present value of expected future cash flows 
relating to an instrument.</p>

<p class=para>With respect to the Bank, the principle determinants of fair value are the
expected cash flows, interest rates, exchange rates and credit risk. The fair
values of assets and liabilities are not considired to be significantly 
different from their carrying value.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Subsequent events</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>We refer to the notes to the balance sheet (consolidation principles) in 
which the closure of the Tiraspol branch is mentioned together with the
estimated result on the Bank's financial position.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Appropriation of the result</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>For the financial year 1997, the Shareholder's meeting has decided to 
declare a devidend of Lei 4,691,000. The dividend is based upon the statutory 
financial statements according to Moldovan Accounting Standards. The profit 
distribution has been included in the balance sheet as at 31 December 1997.</p>

</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>1. Legal status and principal activities</strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Victoriabank was established in the Republic of Moldova in 1989.
The Bank was re-established as a joint stock commercial bank on August 26, 
1991.</p>

<p class=para>Victoriabank is a comprehensive joint stock lending establishment, 
offering a complete set of banking operations and services to small- and 
medium-sized enterprises. The principal goal of the Bank is to promote, support 
and finance private business and enterpreneurship, as well as create the 
conditions essential for the transformation from a central planed to market 
economy within the Republic of Moldova.</p>

<p class=para>As at December 31, 1998, the Bank has 7 branches in Moldova, 
located in Chishinau, Balts, Floreshti, Soroka, Nisporeni, Kaushany and 
Orhei.</p>

<p class=para>Victoriabank has received a blanket licence to execute operations 
in foreign currencies. It established correcpondent relations with a number of
international banks.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>2. Principles of presentation
<br>
<br>
<i>General</i></strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>The financial statements for the year 1998 have prepared in 
accordance with International Accounting Standards.</p>

<p class=para>The Bank maintains its accounting records in accordance with the 
banking regulations prevailing in Moldova and in accordance with National
Accounting Standards and prepares its statutory financial statements on such 
basis. Adjustments have been made in order to present the financial statements 
in accordance with International Accounting Standards.</p>

<p class=para>The financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, except for the tangible fixed assets. In accordance with the 
regulations as set by Ministry of Finance in Moldova, the Bank revalued
the fixed assets by applying indices to the cost price of certain categories 
of fixed assets.</p>

<p class=para>The financial statements have been prepared after the statutory 
appropriation of profit. All amounts are stated in Moldovan Lei unless 
otherwise noted.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong><i>Principles of consolidation</i></strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>The 1998 financial statements include the figures of the branches in
Chishinau, Balts, Floreshti, Soroka, Nisporeni, Kaushany and Orhei.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong><i>Inflation</i></strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>The rate of inflation for 1998 amounted to approximately 18.3% 
(1997: 11.2%).</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong><i>Economical and political risks affecting the Bank</i></strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>The Bank faces a number of risks and challenges due to the 
political and economical instability in Moldova as a result of the transition 
from a centrally planed economy to a market economy. They may have a 
potentially negative effect on the financial position and operations of the 
Bank.</p>

<br>
<p class=subtitle>
<strong>Accounting principles<br>
<br>
<i>General</i></strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Assets and liabilities are started at nominal value, unless 
mentioned otherwise.</p>
<p class=subtitle>
<strong><i>Foreign currency translation</i></strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated to Lei at year-end exchange rates. The official exchange rate at 
year-end was Lei 8.32 - USD 1 (1997: Lei 4.66 - USD 1). Transactions and the 
resulting income and charges in foreign currencies are converted at the rate

<p class=para>The loan portfolio includes loans to the Bank's shareholders 
amounting to Lei 0.2 million (1997: 2.5 million). The terms and conditions of 
those loans are similar to other loans granted in the Bank's ordinary course

<p class=para>The Bank's lending activities are conducted primarily in Moldova.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk in one specific sector.

(inventory, equipment, cars, real estate, etc.). As at December 31, 1998,
10 customers have an outstanding balance higher than Lei 1 million amounting to
Lei 53,383,531, which makes up 45% of the loan portfolio.

</p>

<p class=para>The Bank has entered into a number of transactions with 
shareholders during the year on an arm's length basis.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong>26. Financial instruments<br>
<br>
<i>Introduction</i></strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>As defined by IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and 
Presentation) a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a 
financial assets of one enterprise and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another enterprise.</p>

<p class=para>Within the balance sheet of the Bank, the majority of financial 
assets and liabilities are captured by this definition. Off-balance sheet items 
such as letters of credit and guarantees are also included in the definition. 
IAS 32 requires certain disclosure on the risks and fair values associated with
financial instruments.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong><i>Interest rate risk</i></strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Changes in the market interest rates have a direct impact on the
contractually determined cash flows associated with some financial assets and 
liabilities, when these bear interest rates which are periodically reset to
market rates, and on the fair value of others for which the interest rates are
fixed throughout the period of the contract.</p>

<p class=para>The residual maturity of assets and liabilities is presented in 
the notes to the balance sheet. Substantially almost all financial assets and 
a smaller part of financial liabilities are interest bearing. Rates are set at 
or around current market levels, using requirements set by and guidance from 
the National Bank of Moldova. Most of the Bank's assets and 
liabilities reprise within one year and interest percentages can in many cases 
be changed upon the Bank's discretion. Accordingly, there is little risk of a 
significant interest mismatch.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong><i>Credit risk</i></strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Disclosure of credit risk enables the user of financial 
information to assess the extent to which failures by counterparts to 
discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash inflows 
from financial assets on hand at the balance sheet date. In making this 
assessment, consideration is given to the value of the collateral.</p>

<p class=para>The information required for this assessment can be obtained 
directly from the balance sheet and related notes with respect to credit risk 
exposure, such as loans and advances, guarantees and letters of credit.</p>

<p class=subtitle>
<strong><i>Fair value</i></strong><br>
</p>

<p class=para>Fair value information is widely used in determining an 
enterprise's overall financial position and in making decision about individual 
financial instruments. It is also relevant to many decisions made by users of 
financial statements since, in many circumstances, it reflects the judgement of 
the financial markets as to the present value of expected future cash flows 
relating to an instrument.</p>

<p class=para>With respect to the Bank, the principle determinants of fair 
value are the expected cash flows, interest rates, exchange rates and credit 
risk. The fair values of assets and liabilities are not considired to be 
significantly different from their carrying value.</p>

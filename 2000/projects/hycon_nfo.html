   HYC0N is a prorgam for playing with hypergraph images. It was developed
   as a part of hypergraph management package, developed by students of the
   State University of Moldova under supervision by associate professor
   Vitalii Voloshin (vol@cinf.usm.md).

   This program can:

        (->     read UDS files (see UDS specs in help)

        (->     construct hypergraph image using linear, B-spline or
                Cat-Mull Rom splines

        (->     perform some relocation operations: place vertices
                on circle, zoom image in and out, fit it to screen

        (->     Save back modified hypergraph structure to UDS file

        (->     Export hypergraph image in PiCTeX (*.PIC) file format,
                usable from TeX compilation systems (emTeX, PCTeX).
                You can also post-edit generated PiCTeX files with
                TeXCAD program from emTeX distribution

        (->     Export hypergraph image in PCX format, usable from a
                wide set of programs (Microsoft Word and Excel etc.)

        (->     Export hypergraph image in TGA format, usable from
                some programs (3D Studio, POVRAY, CompuSHOW etc.)

   I'm the last year student at Department of Mathematical Cybernetics of
   the State University of Moldova. Born in December 22, 1975. Have some
   background in programming. My prefered programming languages are C++
   and Pascal with object-oriented extensions (Delphi-like). Prefered
   compilers: DJGPP 2.01, Watcom 11.0, MSVC 4.02, Delphi 2.1 and
   GNU CC 2.7.2.1 under FreeBSD. My interest in computers is computer
   graphics, especialy image filtering and 3D modelling/rendering.

   If you have some brilliant theoretical ideas and search for a
   programmer to realize them in form of fast and bug-free code, I'm
   your man. Just send me a message. I can code for DOS (DJGPP, Watcom),
   Windows 95/NT  (MSVC, Watcom, Delphi) and Unix (GNU CC).

   Or regular mail:                     Adrian Oboroc
